This is simple example of usage OpenCV library.

Just download project and enjoy it :) (strongly for windows-users)

For running add to classpath lib from src\main\resources\..
test file OpenCVExample-master\fire_test.txt contains some data about fires: temparature, humidity, wind power. 
And label column with count of fires.
